GraPhysAni Project 3
By: James Kelly and Eric Marcinowski

The improvements we've made to our project are as follows:

***Lighting***
Our lights are no longer determined within the the program itself; they can all be load via the XML reader and can even change their
brightness, colour, range, attenuation, etc.

***Z-Sorting***
Our Z-sort method was.....well, inefficient. The new method that we have implemented gives the program a bigger boost in performance (a whole 15 frames, WOW!)
It may not be 60fps when looking at all objects at once, but hey, who wants that anyway? It's not as cinematic, right? *Citation needed*

***Physics***
The whole physics section has been entirely reworked from Physics 2; It now uses PhysProp and CMesh as part of the gaemObject to do
collision detection. We've also incorporated a "bounce" mechanic when the ship (Viper) collides with the Environment (City, in this case)

Controls:
r - resets camera to starting position
b - write the object's information to Scene2.txt
1 - switch between the Game Running, Light Editor, or Object Editor
4 - draw the hitboxes used in our physics information
m - generate particles
t/T - toggle between which light/object is currently being focused on
h - locks the "lightball" onto the location of the current light (this must be combined with the f key to follow the selected light)
p - print current light information
c - print camera and current object information

(If the camera is not following the object which can be toggled on and off with the f key, the following buttons move the camera independently)
Camera Controls: 
w - move camera forward
s - move camera backward 
a - move camera left 
d - move camera right 
q - move camera up 
e - move camera down
shift + a - "look" left 
shift + d - "look" right 
shift + e - "look" up 
shift + q - "look" down 
f - follow targeted object (press again to not follow) 

Ship Controls
(if the camera is following the ship then they instead move the ship, 
these directions change if the player has been rotated with the alternate ship controls)
w - move forward
s - move backward 
a - move left 
d - move right 
e - move up 
q - move down 
f - follow targeted object (press again to not follow) 
space - stop velocity

Alternate Ship Controls
(these controls allow the player to rotate the ship and have it travel in the direction it is face, similar to actually flying a ship)
2 - move in the direction the ship is facing
3 - move in the direction the ship is facing (aka "backing up")
left/right arrow key - turn ship left or right
up/down arrow key - turn ship down or up
page up/page down - tilt ship sideways
space - stop velocity and rotations of the ship


Light Editing mode controls: (these controls only work if the game state is set to editing lights which can be changed by pressing '1'
Camera Controls: Same as ship controls it depends if the camera is focused on the light (you must press both 'f' and 'h' keys for this to work with lights)

Light controls
these directions change if the player has been rotated with the alternate ship controls)
w - move forward
s - move backward 
a - move left 
d - move right 
e - move up 
q - move down 
u/U - constant attenuation
i/I - linear attenuation
o/O - quadratic attenuation
j/J - red light color
k/K - green light color
l/L - blue light color
